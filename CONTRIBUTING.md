# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,

## A Few Things to Know Before Contributing

- This project uses Prettier with **only one** setting changed: `printWidth: 100` _(You don't have to worry about eslint-prettier warns, because the code is formatted automatically before any commit)_ PS: If you think that eslint-prettier is annoying, you can "eslint.run": "onSave" on your editor.

- We use Gitmoji :clown_face: to make better commit messages. (Just get the gitmoji code [here](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) and past on the commit message).

- The folder structure is based on the needs of the project, if you want to change it, please open an issue.

- The CSS styles are all in modules, if you want something in the global scope please use the `src/index.css`.

- The project doesn't follow a visual design language (like Material Design), but please try to no lose the visual identity.
